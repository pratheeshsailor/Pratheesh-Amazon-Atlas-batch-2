/*Assumptions in JUnit 5 - checks the test cases conditionally based on preconditions.
if Assumption is failed then it is marked as skipped rather than failed.
Means Assumptions are used when we want to skip a test.


assumeTrue() - used to skip the test when a specified condition is not true for assumeTrue or not false for assumeFalse.
assumingThat() - to execute a block of code based on a Boolean Assumptions, If the Assumptions is false the block is skipped.*/
